# my-projects

In this repository, I put some of my mini-projects and practices.
A list of files:
  1. NMPC.py -> in this file an offset-free nonlinear model predictive control is implemented using tensorflow and scipy.
  2. eo_flash.py -> using Pyomo as a algebraic modeling language a simple equation oriented flash calculation is developed.
  3. reactor.py -> using Pyomo and its capability to
  4. PINN.py -> A physics informed neural network is develped using tensorflow v2 for a pde benchmark.
