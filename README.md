# my-projects

In this repository, I put some of my mini-projects and practices.
A list of files:
  1. NMPC.py ->   In this file, an offset-free nonlinear model predictive control is implemented using tensorflow and scipy.
  2. eo_flash.py ->   Using Pyomo as an algebraic modeling language a simple equation oriented flash calculation is developed.
  3. reactor_optimization.py ->   Using Pyomo and its capability to discritize optimization prblem domain automatically, a plug flow reactor is optimized using Ipopt solver of the optimization problem.
